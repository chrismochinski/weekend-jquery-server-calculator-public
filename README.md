## This application acts as a simple calculator that does correct calculations efficiently and stores previous equations for the user's reference.

In this app, a user inputs a number in each of two appropriate fields and selects an operator - addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. Once the "=" button is pressed, the calculation completes itself and is displayed below. 

The user can also press the "C" button to clear both fields and any operator selection. Pressing it a second time will clear the previous (large) equation. Please note that both form fields must be filled in with a number, and an operator must be selected in order to utilize this application. 

As the user adds more equations, they are stored below for reference. <br />
